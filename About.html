        <h2>Home design</h2>
        <p>Apples or oranges? New York or L.A.? Spotify or Apple Music? Warriors or Thunder? These days you can pick your corner, your subculture, your team, and just wallow yourself to death in it. Even with interior design, there are so many options that are all fashionable at once. You want your Steampunk Man Cave? How about your Zen Room, Safe Room, or Retro Midcentury Tiki Scream Room? Feel free to let your interior-design freak flag fly. But do it right. At opposite poles of this vast spectrum of sanctimonious spaces are minimum and maximum. Both styles are aesthetically ambitious and completely relevant right now. Would you care for a spare, elegant, sophisticated style for your home's interior? Or a highly personalized hemorrhagic tableau expressing your multifaceted collections and richly curated life? After your sartorial style, your interior decoration may be the most personal billboard of them all.

            So…what's right for you?

            Minimalism is the design equivalent of a 1,500-calorie-a-day diet—and about as difficult to adhere to. To paraphrase Baloo from The Jungle Book, it's the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities, forget about your clutter and your strife. Minimalism is a philosophy, a reaction to all of modern life's visual vomit. As the world becomes more cacophonous, perhaps a design alternative is to have your home decor simplified, calm, and serene, with a heightened sense of clarity. The idea is to put all your thought and dough into just a few really great treasures. Then fine-tune every detail. The style of a picture frame, the kind of cord on the lamp, the finish on the floor. Stuff you wouldn't notice if the room was cluttered becomes a beacon when a space is pared down. It has been said that minimalism is not a style that precludes possession, but a style that precludes careless possession. Only the essentials, thank you very much.</p>
